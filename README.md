## About
As the acronym suggests, this is a programming language designed specifically for teaching programming.

The goal was to create a language that was easy to teach and understand, with the intention of being a middle option
between teaching programming with flow diagrams (too abstract) or with mainstream languages (too broad).

To achieve this, three principles were followed:
- Implementing only the bare necessities for a programming language.
- Adopting a verbose but natural syntax.
- Enforcing an inflexible but consistent coding style.

These ideas have lead to a language that should be very intuitive for beginners while intentionally inconvenient 
for development outside of learning-level programs.
